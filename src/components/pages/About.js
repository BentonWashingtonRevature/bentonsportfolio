                Hi! My name is Benton Washington and i aspire to be the one of the best software engineers in the world.
                My passion has always been creative problem solving and innovation. I will not settle on simply solving a problem
                because I believe even when things are going well, there is always a better way to do things. As I move along in my 
                software engineering career, you will notice this theme in my projects. With each project, you will also
                notice projects that empower others, authenticity, simplicity, community, and most of all love. My life's mission
                is to bring people towards their God-given dreams. Currently,
                I am young in my career but very driven with a lot to work towards. Thank you!
